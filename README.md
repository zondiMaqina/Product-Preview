## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  width: fit-content;
}
```

### Challenges

I had a challenge when it came to controling the image's responsiveness i could not make it take full width of flexbox container until i realised it was actually a BACKGROUND-IMAGE

### Continued development

I look forward to strengthening my responsiveness skills when it comes to css
